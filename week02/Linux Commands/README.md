## Linux warmups
A really useful Linux [commands](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/bash_cheat_sheet.pdf).

### 1. Folder hierarchy
Use the command line to create the following directory structure:

```
A
|---B
|---C
|   |---E
|   |---F
|       |---G
|---D
    |---H
    |---I
```

Where `A` is the root folder, `B`, `C` and `D` are its direct subfolders and so on.
_Bonus points if you do it in 5 commands._

### 2. Panda
Using the folder structure above, create a file named `panda` in folder `G`. It should contain this text:
```
A Panda bear walks into a restaurant. He orders a meal and eats it.
After politely paying for his meal, he pulls out a gun and shoots it in the air. He immediately walks out the door. "Why did you do that?" hollered the confused waitress.
Looking back over his shoulder the panda says "I'm a panda". "Look it up in the dictionary."
The waitress locates the dictionary on her bosses desk and searches for the definition of panda bear. Finding it she reads, "Panda Bear - A large black and white bear like mammal native to the far east. Eats shoots and leaves."
``` 
_Bonus points if you do it in a single command._

### 3. The day panda was cloned
Copy the file `panda` into files named `panda1`, `panda2` and `panda3` in `G` and remove the original file. 
_Bonus points if you do this in 3 commands._ 

### 4. Penguin
Where there are pandas, there are also penguins. Create three empty files `penguin1`, `penguin2` and `penguin3`.
_Bonus points if you do this with a single command._

### 5. The panda factory
In the directory `E` create a new directory `J`, which has the same contents as `G`. 
_Bonus points if you do this in a single command._
